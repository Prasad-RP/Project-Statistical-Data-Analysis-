# Statistical-Data-Analysis-Project-In-C-Language
This Project is developed in c language.
I'm used basic knowledge of Statistics in project.
In statistics data having 3 types: 
1.Raw Data
2.Discrete Data
3.Continuous Data

With the help of above code you can find mean,
mode,median, variance, standard deviation of 
above types of data. Also you can find skewness
of data.

How to Run Code:
Choose data from options.
While entering observations
For Raw data :
First Enter total no.of obs: 5
Type Raw Observations like this.
10 30 40 55 88 

For Discrete Data:
First Enter total no.of obs: 5
Type Discreate Observations like this.
10 30 40 55 88 
Then,
Type frequency of obs(serially):
03 04 08 05 05

For Continuous Data:
First Enter total no.of obs: 5
Type Continuous Observations like this.
10 20
20 30
30 40
40 50
50 60
Then,
Type frequency of obs(serially):
08 06 08 07 09

Hope you got favorable output
   Thank You !!!ðŸ–¤ðŸ˜Š
